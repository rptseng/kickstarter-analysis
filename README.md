# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

git### Purpose
Using a dataset from Kickstarter, we will perform 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
This visualization displays the outcomes "Theater" Kickstarter campaigns by the month of the year that they were launched.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
This visualization displays the outcomes of "Plays" Kickstarter campaigns by their funding goals, grouped by intervals of $5000.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Theater outcomes by launch date does not factor in the year

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Are these conclusions to be drawn strictly from the pivot tables produced in the Challenge?
The month with the most successful Theater campaigns is May
The month with the highest percentage of successful Theater campaigns is May


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The highest percentage of successful campaigns for plays are those with goals set at less than $1000

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Is it the limitations of the data set or limitations of the analysis?
We exclude live campaigns
We include subcategories musicals and spaces as theater campaigns, but they are not plays.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could make a box plot showing the distribution of Goals($) with Successful Outcomes by Launch Month in "plays" campaigns. 
Using this graphic we can observe the range of goals that are likely to be successful when launched in a given month. This might help Louise set a goal that is more likely to be funded depending on when she needs to launch the campaign, or help her choose a launch date if she's determined how much money she needs to raise for her campaign.
